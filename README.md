# Pre-Installation
To install my packages, you need to have [DexI](https://github.com/Dotsian/DexI/) installed. You can install it by getting [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and then running:
```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Dotsian/DexI
```

After that, you can check if DexI is installed by running ``dexi --help`` to view all commands. If it works, check the next step.

# Installation
To install my packages, run these commands after installing DexI:
```bash
dexi add wascertified/custom-cogs --branch (package name)
dexi install
```
You can check what packages there are, by click the button thats written as "main". There you can find my packages.
Heres an example:
```bash
dexi add wascertified/custom-cogs --branch battle
dexi install
```
This will install the ``battling`` package for you.
